Hello.

This is a letter from Aotearoa New Zealand where Prime Minister Jacinda Arden has pronounced the country under Alert Stage-4 lockdown.
This is effectively a shelter in place for all non-essential personnel, when not going out to scavenge or escape cabin fever.

Four weeks, the Prime Minister said. Four weeks. Please stay at home.

Could it really be that hard?


Well, what happens when the world as it is is forced to stay in the place they think of as home, with no work or people. No external influences.

What happens when they can only seek solace?

Solitude. Or solace? Or torture?
