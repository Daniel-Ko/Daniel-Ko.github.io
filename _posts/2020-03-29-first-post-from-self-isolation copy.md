My voice!

I may be sick. I may be spiteful. I may be unattractive. But I think I'm still young enough to consider alternate perspectives.

It is certainly a rude and frightening world out there, don't you agree? The reason I don't have a public voice yet is because being vulnerable on the internet is a strange, strange deal. Who would want to be known only to be mocked? But perhaps nobody will read this. I'm just stepping out here.

I apologise for assuming the worst about you, reader. Will you mock? Would you? I don't think we know each other very well, then. I will try to be punctual and consistent. One of the hardest promises to make. We shall see if I keep to my end of the deal.

Your part is to read, consider, and provide feedback. Lord knows I get enough feedback from myself. It's what I've been doing for years and years. 
See, the point about having a voice - of course I have it, and it gets quite noisy at exciting times, or sometimes for no reason at all. That means it's LOUD. That's a certain paradox I notice that fits nicely as a theme...a thematic summary of who this author is now. 

I have self esteem and confidence, inner things that other people like to gather around to grate off. But where I see my potential is actual, others may give the most dismissive of cursory glances to see actual as unimpressive and, sorry, who are you and where's your potential again?

But do you know, reader, what was the chief point about my spite? Why, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that continually, even in the moment of the acutest conflict of inner and outer feedback, I was inwardly concious with shame that I am being affected after all! It's really really frickin hard to balance happiness that comes from the inside with the drive to do something substantial outside.

I am in New Zealand, and content. But wait and let's see. This is a first step out. Which is funny because the country is in full lockdown in fear of a global pandemic and taking a step out is the last thing you would want to do.
